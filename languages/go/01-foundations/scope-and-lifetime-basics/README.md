# Scope and Lifetime Basics (Go)

This module practices variable lifetime in blocks and safe accumulation patterns.

## Learning Metadata

- Difficulty: Beginner.
- Estimated Time: 20-35 minutes.
- Prerequisites: `01-foundations/functions`, `01-foundations/control-flow`.
- Cross-Language Lens: Compare block scope everywhere, then contrast deterministic destruction in C++ with garbage-collected lifetime in the other tracks.

## Quick Run

~~~bash
go run example/main.go
~~~

## Topics Covered

- Variables declared in branches and loops.
- Accumulator patterns scoped to full function lifetime.
- Conditional assignment before use.
- Guard clauses for invalid ranges.

## Common Pitfalls

- Using values before they are assigned in all branches.
- Declaring accumulators inside loops by mistake.
- Skipping range validation for score or count inputs.

## Exercise Focus

- exercises/01.go: map numeric score ranges to a letter grade using branch-local logic.
- exercises/02.go: accumulate N integers and compute sum and average from shared state.

### Exercise Specs

1. exercises/01.go
- Input: integer score expected in the range 0..100.
- Output: single letter grade from A to F.
- Edge cases: scores below 0 or above 100; exact boundary values 60/70/80/90.

2. exercises/02.go
- Input: positive count and then count integer values.
- Output: sum and average values.
- Edge cases: count <= 0; negative numbers within the sequence.
